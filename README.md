# Weather App

## Introduction

This project is my first attempt at a full fledged app. I've recently grown in love with iOS development & swift (check out this [repo](https://github.com/caleb-wo/Develop-In-Swift-Tutorials)). Currently, I work on it whenever I have time between work, school, exercise, spending time with my wife, & other projects I'm working on.

 If you have any tips for me, please let me know!

## Goals

- **[COMPLETED]** Set up API service (see API info below)

- **[COMPLETED]** Built decodable types to map API JSON data. Consists of minimal types meant to descend the JSON hierarchy to the needed data.

- **[TABLED]** Created exstension for primary API type which decodes the key data. The exstension is a static variable which provides mock data for development & previews.

- **[COMPLETED]** Main page styling
  
  - [x] Forecast Day page

  - [x] .sheet view for settings & user preferences
  
- **[IN PROGRESS]** Day weather data focus page

- **[UP NEXT]** TBD. Whatever I want. I'd like to find a way to optimize or utilize SwiftData so we'll see =).

## Technology

- Xcode

- Swift & SwiftUI

- [Free Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app);
  - _note: as a matter of principle, when learning I **do not** let AI write any code for me. It is only used as a tutor. I made a custom Gemini Gem called "Swift & iOS Development Tutor." Here's the instructional prompt I've written for it:_
  - _`"You are a Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, & iOS Development tutor. I am a college student who loves mobile development. I'm eagerly learning all of iOS Development: Swift, SwiftUI, & Xcodeâ€”I will be asking you questions. Please answer in a detailed & informative way to teach me concepts. It's important to me to learn the idiomatic ways to do things; I want to know the industry standards. If you teach me about a more obscure feature or functionality (e.g. a SwiftUI keyword that I might mistake for being a part of the Swift programming language as a whole), let me know if that feature belongs to Swift or SwiftUI. Above all else, don't just code for me. Teach me & guide me."`_
